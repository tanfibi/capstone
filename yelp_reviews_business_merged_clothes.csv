1. Iovine Brothers Produce - Even at the cheapest of supermarkets, I couldn't get a whole bag of the freshest, highest quality vegetables for $5. Same goes to the nuts and snacks on the southern wall, where else can you buy them in such a state of quality at such prices?

2. Godshall's Poultry - Instead of the yellowed, hormoned chicken you get from the supermarket, these are the freshest, tastiest chicken you can find in the city. And fresh chickens do make a difference in taste. Of course, they do have ducks, quails, turkeys and eggs.

3. Martin's and John Yi's is where I get my meat and seafood, Martin's is always a few bucks cheaper and John Yi captures me with their neon signs.

4. 4 Seasons Juice Bar has the tastiest fruit smoothies and blends around. My favorite is Pineapple (for sweetness) + Banana (for texture) + Orange (for taste). Nothing beats a 20oz No.4 in a hot summer day.

5. For your dessert needs, Flying Monkey has the best cupcakes and lemon bars in town. Termini Brothers has a killer chocolate covered banana on a crescent cookie. You can also visit the ladies at Famous 4th for a fresh baked cookie. For something completely evil, you can go to the Amish bakery for a cinnamon roll with nuts AND frosting.

6. Shanghai Gourmet's American Chinese food is as good as any place in Chinatown. Try their fried rice or the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, it's not on their menu but the jumbo shrimps in the silky luscious sauce is to die for. (gulp)

7. The Spice Terminal will fulfill most of your gourmet needs. Bee Natural has a wide variety of honeys. For cheese and charcuterie, you can visit Salumeria and if not for anything else, go to By George for their pasta sauces, they'll even sell you pizza dough if you want to make something at home. 

It's a vibrant place with lots of other places to discover and it's a great place to walk and browse when you have the time. Just don't stand in the middle of the aisle and block traffic, it can be crowded. Cell phone reception can be on the low side, and it's hard for the working folks to pick up groceries on their way home since most of the shop will close business around 5, but there's the weekend.

I'm pretty sure this was before I turned into a Food Network junkie, before I ever cooked for myself, before I had any kind of appreciation for fresh, quality ingredients, and certainly long before I began Yelping.

What my friends and I thought would be a pretty quick trip turned into a two-hour exploration.  Because it was a Sunday morning, the Amish vendors were closed, but since I have yet to sample their wares, I didn't miss them.  There was plenty to choose from: produce, spices, meat, cheeses, seafood, baked goods...  Maybe it was just the novelty of the place, but I felt inspired to create.

When we had finally filled our shopping bags with various fresh finds, we decided to get something prepared to eat.  We ended up at Kamal's Middle Eastern Specialties, where I tasted my first falafel and lamb shawerma.  Delish!  We ended at Flying Monkey Patisserie where, forced with too many choices, I ordered a brownie to eat at that moment, plus 4 different cupcakes to take home.

If you've been to Seattle's Pike Market, then this is a more urban and New England version of it. It has produce from farms, heritage varieties, fresh eggs, cheddars, deli, meats, and bakeries that offer mouth watering pastries. There's also a large variety of food stands and stalls that offer a very impressive variety of foods from barbecue, to breakfast, desserts, Indian, African, and Hillel foods. 

Prices- That's what everyone always wants to know especially if it's a tourist attraction. So in terms of produce, it's not bad priced. Not as high as whole foods, but certainly not your Italian Marketplace where you can haggle your way down to pennies. One can probably get some quality farmer produce for a reasonable price of like 1.99$/lb for apples or 2 for 1$ corn to give an idea of the ballpark range. The food is also pretty reasonable priced. You can get a whole lunch set for less than 10$ and the portions are large. You can order most foods for less than 10$ here. 

Hours- so this place is open until 6 pm on most days, so if you're going to go, do not bank on this place on being your dinner place, because chances are most of the produce will have been sold off, stalls are closing, and you may be left with whatever is leftover (meaning smaller selection). I recommend hitting this place for lunch or even late afternoon stop as you wrap up your activities. 

Food: What to try- there are a few places that have their original site outside the marketplace. Meltykraft and Metropolitan Bakery have their own stand alone branches outside of this marketplace for example, so I recommend trying places that cannot be found outside- this may require a little more research, but the Indian food place for 9.99$ lunch set looked amazing and line moved fast. The Amish desserts are also a hit here as well. 

Amount of time recommended- you can probably spend a couple of hours in this establishment. It is massive and overwhelming. It has almost everything, so don't go in starving because you'll probably just wind up sitting at the first place you see and stuffing your face and then be sad you can't put down the amazing looking treats ahead.",qUfRCH5NUyRDsJfM6jA5PQ,51 N 12th St,"Candy Stores, Shopping, Department Stores, Fast Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Fruits & Veggies, Chinese, Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Seafood, Health Markets, Bagels, Cheese Shops, Shopping Centers, Chocolatiers & Shops, Meat Shops, Public Markets, Food Court, Wineries, Local Flavor, Ethnic Food, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Arts & Entertainment, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Seafood Markets, Farmers Market, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Food Stands, Dinner Theater, Sporting Goods, Grocery, Fashion",Philadelphia,39.9533414645,-75.1588545174,Reading Terminal Market,19107,5721,4.5,PA,1,1

So many delicious smells and sights and flavors! When I came back, I was a bit better acclimated. It's not as large or as expansive as the Mercato Centrale in Florence, but it's pretty big!
One of the mainstays there is DiNic's, which makes a revered roast pork sandwich comprised of three ingredients: Roast pork, sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. The cheese provides a tanginess and prevents the pork juice from soaking through the roll; the pork is slow-roasted and delicious, while the broccoli rabe provides some crunch and offsets the sweetness of the pork. Justifiably loved by many.
The many Amish stores there are also worth checking out; there's a fresh-made doughnut shop that's excellent and a country-style diner that serves breakfast fit for powering field hands.

If you are there for the Apple Dumplings make sure you don't go on Sunday as the Dutch side of the market is not open on Sunday's. 

I tried Tommy Dicnic's and I must say it was a great sandwich. We got there for lunch and the beef brisket was not in stock. I must say, do a little research on how to order your sandwich. This helped us be able to order quickly and feel comfortable about what we ordered.

The pork sandwich, wet, with broccoli rabi and cheese was a HIT! It was large enough for two of us to split it as a snack. We decided to try multiple things around the market.... Don't let the long lines scare you..

DICNIC'S TIP: If you find a seat at Dicnic's sit down and you won't have to wait in line!!!!

This place is great and I'm a big fan of marketplaces like Pike Place and Chelsea Market, so I had to go visit. It's located conveniently near the Convention Center, so if you're ever in town for an event there it makes it perfect for grabbing an affordable meal. 

For a Sunday a lot of the vendors were open. It was nice to just walk around and see all the varieties of food available. It seems like they have everything  from Indian to Mexican to Kosher Deli to Crepes. Along with prepared food, there are numerous meat, cheese, produce, bread, bakeries, chocolate, etc vendors. It is a foodie's heaven as any market is.  It was pretty busy around the one entrance we came through as a produce/meat stand was right there. My companion and I setted on some fried chicken from Delilahs which I was told was beat by Bobby Flay during a Macaroni and Cheese smackdown challenge thing. Afterwards we went to Flying Monkey Bakery for brownies and walked around. There is plenty of seating, as most food stands have counter seating and there are tables and chairs located throughout the market. The only downside is that there is one bathroom and it's pretty small so you probably have to wait.

There is an abundance of food options. If you're in the neighborhood and want something fast and tasty, this is a good place to go. You can choose to sit down and eat (like at Molly Malloy's) or you can grab something fast and walk around with it (Olympia Gyro).

I am also particularly fond of the home made chocolate retailers. Yum!

The main reason that we go to RTM, though, is for the humanely raised and organic meats. There are several Amish stands that specialize in selling *real* meat (not genetically modified, hormone-injected, tortured animals). You should check them out!

Parking can be a real bitch, though, so you're better off taking public transportation if you're not going to have too many bags to carry.

For those unfamiliar, RTM is a large building consisting of many small businesses and stands ranging from groceries to eateries to miscellaneous goods.

Overall, the place is clean and you're able to find just about anything food-related you might have a craving for.

Most businesses and eateries have their own review pages and websites for those curious. 

Two important things to note: 1) The Pennsylvania Dutch retail section is not open the same hours as the entire market due to their beliefs and scheduling. This section is normally only open Wednesday to Saturday. 10+ of the stands are qualified as PA Dutch, Amish, or Mennonite and as such missing them is a significant chunk of the market.

and 2) Parking is generally done in garages near to the market, though it can get expensive quickly.

These days you can find some really good weekly Farmers Markets in many towns and, occasionally you find a daily like the Reading Terminal Market.

We walked in and I was home again. The hustle and bustle of vendors setting up, the aroma of fresh baked Artisan bread, the smell of just brewed hot coffee - mixed with the occasional off-scent of freshly butchered meat or fish - totally transformed my world for a few minutes from hectic ""day-to-day-today"" to a more bucolic boyhood.

-Beiler's donuts will make you a believer.
-Kamal's has the absolute best falafel I've ever tasted and amazing fresh juices and smoothies.
-a trip to reading terminal is not complete without a stop to Bassett's for some Philadelphia-style ice cream.

I could seriously write about this place all day. Take the train or bus if you don't want to deal with traffic and parking. If you park in the garage directly across the street with the big sign that tells you it's discounted if you get it validated inside, it's not lying. If you have a few people with you and don't mind driving in city traffic, it is definitely a bargain.

This market has everything from homemade pickles to cheeses to fudges to pancakes to fresh bread to gyros to cheese steaks. If you want to eat it, this market has it. 

The lines are long but the people watching is endless so time flys by faster than you expect even in some of the longest lines you will probably stand in. This is one of my all time favorite markets. 

Beiler's donuts is a must. It's one of the most spongy and bouncy donuts you will eat. They make the donuts right in front of you! Try the apple fritters!!! This place has a line that passes Dutch eating place and the fudge shop. 

This market has bee wax candles to little gift shops. It pays to stop by this market to pick up some little gifts and keepsakes. 

Another place you have to try is the Dutch eating place. The restaurant has great specials. Get their Ruben sandwich. This place is a must for breakfast.

One place I do not recommend is tommy dinic's. This place makes me angry cause I waited in line for so long just to get a low quality sandwich. I was expecting their sandwich to be delicious because of all the hype. I was a bit confused as to why people were so excited about this place. I really was so confused and I am still confused by it. I also feel like I will forever be confused as to why people are so infatuated by this place. It's really not worth the wait nor is the hype real. They don't have a huge depth of flavor profiles in their sandwich. I give dinic's two stars. But their service is quick and very friendly. 

Overall, this market is a must when in the city.

It's not that it's a good idea to have such a wide breadth of local flavor all in one place it's the execution that's lacking.  

What I mean is that most of the local flavor is represented but it's represented poorly meaning that most of the food is mediocre which is too bad considering you can walk a couple blocks to get the best of (insert food style).  In most cases, it's not who makes the best of a certain type of food but who can afford to pay the rent there.  What would really make the pace special is if they chose the top vendors as opposed to whoever can pay the most rent.  

The other issue, and this is a big one, is the lack of being open on Sunday.  This is really a chicken/egg issue.  Are most businesses closed on Sunday because of lack of business or is there a lack of business because most of them are closed?  All I know is this seems to be an epidemic in what is a city the size of Philadelphia.  In order to attract people into the center of city during the weekend, it has to be open first.  I understand that many of the businesses have religious reasons for not working on the Lord's day but this is akin to Chinatown shutting down one day a week in New York.

RTM is a huge public market with a lot of vendors - there are an overwhelming amount of options! From fresh produce, to seafood, to meat, to cheese, you can get almost anything here! You can get pastries, coffee, tea, ice cream,  Pennsylvania Dutch, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, Cajun, burgers, cheesesteaks, and more! There's even an oyster bar inside. Great variety! 

Stopped in at lunchtime on a weekday and the place was just packed with people everywhere. No surprise that it's a popular stop for locals and tourists to get some lunch. The line at Beiler's Donuts was the longest, as was the line for Hershel's East Side Deli. There are communal seating areas, but at lunchtime the tables were filled. I came back the next day early in the morning and while not everything was open, there were definitely less people and less chaotic. 

What I was most interested in was the Pennsylvania Dutch businesses. There's a sign by the Dutch Eating Place that says the hours for the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants being Tuesday or Wednesday through Saturday, closing up at 3PM on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and closing up at 5PM Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. But I was there on a Monday and Beiler's was definitely in operation, though Dutch Eating Place was closed. Aside from Beiler's and the Dutch Eating Place, there's also Miller Twist that has soft pretzels and ice cream, and Riehl's which has cheeses, and Smuckers which supposedly is famous for their pot roast sandwiches. Other Pennsylvania Dutch vendors sell crafts and jams and honey. I returned the following day on a Tuesday to eat at Dutch Eating Place (separate review). 

Overall, RTM is a fun place to visit and a great option if you're not sure what you want to eat - there's bound to be something you're craving if you walk around long enough. I tried tea from the Tea Leaf, tea from Old City Coffee, ice cream from Bassetts, jambalaya from Beck's Cajun Cafe, a donut from Beiler's, a soft pretzel from Miller's Twist, and breakfast from Dutch Eating Place.

I've been coming to RTM since I was in diapers, when the visit required a trip into the city on the R2. Now that I'm in the city, I go often. Usually to grab a crepe for lunch, pick up produce, a preztel from the Amish folks, Bassetts ice cream and any number of other delicious items. But, I can't remember every having gone into the Market before 9AM. 

But, walking from the eastern edge of the Art Museum area, to Independence Hall this morning, I realized that all of my usual coffee stops were no longer on my way to the office. What to do? Of course, there was an Old City Coffee in RTM - but was RTM open at 8:15am? 

Yes, and I think I knew that, I just never tested it out. 

RTM is an entirely different place in the morning - sleepy, warm, free of all the jostling tourists and hoardes of jury duty-ers. Half of the stands are open or are in the process of opening. People behind the counters look up as you walk by and give you a cheerful smile. There are distinct smells of this or that, not the mix and match you get later in the day. After I picked up my coffee, I walked through the entire place to the last door and the only thing I had to dodge was a guy carrying a crate of produce on his head and an older woman buying fish.

I think I faintly remember trying the roast pork sammie from Tommy DeNic's but even if I did, I can't remember what it tastes like. So this time around, I decided to document everything, so that if I do visit Philly again, I'll know what to get (or what not to). Here is everything we ate:

Tommy DeNic's: Roast Pork with Provolone and Broccoli Rabe - this was a nice break from the cheesesteaks that we've been eating. The pork was cooked perfectly, and there was a good amount of provolone and broccoli rabe. It does get messy though, so it's not really a sammie that you could eat on the go.

MeltKraft : Melter Skelter ('Melter Skelter' Raclette 3 Month, pickled green tomatoes, jalapeño, BBQ potato chips, and watercress) - this was good, but not worth $9. I don't know what it is about grilled cheese, but I just can't find a grilled cheese anywhere that's worth paying $10 for.

Beiler's Doughnuts - bought a few doughnuts from here - one crumb, the second cinnamon, and the third I can't remember. This had the longest line. The line wraps around other stands. People seem to buy these doughnuts up by the dozen. My boyfriend really enjoyed the doughnuts but to be, they were just doughnuts. But then again, maybe it's just because I'm not a huge fan.

Herschel's: Corned Beef Sandwich - although I only tried a few bites, the corned beef was pretty good. It wasn't overly salty, like corned beef tends to be. The pickles are great.

Overall, the market is a great place to try out a bunch of different foods.

If only supermarkets would go away and be replaced by thousands of Reading Terminal Markets (although it would lose a little bit of its appeal.)

My favorite spots were Famous 4th Street Cookie Company, Beiler's Bakery, Dutch Eating Place, Sweet as Fudge Candy Shoppe, Lancaster County Dairy, Bee Natural, 12th Street Cantina, Dienner's Bar-B-Q, and Kamal's Middle Eastern Specialities.

The Amish merchants are without a doubt some of the best foods I have ever eaten and what makes the market so special. I ended up buying 2 pounds of various chocolate fudges from Sweet as Fudge, 2 dozen doughnuts from Beiler's, an open faced turkey sandwich from Dutch Eating Place, a Strawberry Orange Lemonade from Lancaster County Dairy, and 3 chocolate chip cookies from Famous 4th Street Cookie Company. 

If you are driving in, make sure to get your parking validated when you spend at least $10 and can park in the garage on Filbert Street for just $4 up to 2 hours. You won't find a better deal for parking anywhere else in the city. When you don't have anything else planned, you can easily spend an entire day here and you'll love every minute of it!",LGsT-m_zXP4V-WvcuarxcA,51 N 12th St,"Candy Stores, Shopping, Department Stores, Fast Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Fruits & Veggies, Chinese, Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Seafood, Health Markets, Bagels, Cheese Shops, Shopping Centers, Chocolatiers & Shops, Meat Shops, Public Markets, Food Court, Wineries, Local Flavor, Ethnic Food, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Arts & Entertainment, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Seafood Markets, Farmers Market, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Food Stands, Dinner Theater, Sporting Goods, Grocery, Fashion",Philadelphia,39.9533414645,-75.1588545174,Reading Terminal Market,19107,5721,4.5,PA,1,1

First off, if you haven't been to similar markets in other cities, let me warn you that much like other ones, this place is packed. People that live here often visit it in addition to out-of-towners.

Unlike markets in other towns, many of the prices can't be beat. Grocery shopping and butchers sell at below market value a good amount of the time so it's hard to avoid going for fresh food. Grab some muffalata or alligator sausage. Also, unlike other markets, it can be hard to walk around at times. I've pushed a stroller through the past couple years without issue (despite my phobias), but unless you're used to all the people, it can be overwhelming.

Nonetheless, the smells and sights are more overwhelming, in a good way.

My faves at the Reading Terminal Market:
DiNic's (either the roast pork or beef with provolone, and sweat peppers)
I dont know the name of the place buts its the only one that sells roast chicken ( wings, leg quarters, or whole or half chickens)
The Dutch Corner of the Market...

The Dutch Corner closes earlier that the rest of the market. I believe close time is 5pm.

If you go to the Market right before it closes you can find good deals on pastries.

$.75 to $1.00 per cookie vs $10.00per pound (each cookie is pretty heavy)
2 for $3.00 pastries when they normally go for$3 plus.

pros!
1. very good selection of fruit and veggies never a bad apple in the bunch, literally. 
2. cheap, well depends on what you're going for. but even if it's expensive its good quality so worth the price!
3. food is good, quick service. ive eaten at several places and the staff is always friendly and helpful. theyre never impatient if you dont know what you want and always have a smile on their faces.
4. it doesnt feel like Philadelphia in here... its like ive died and gone to polite heaven where it smells like sweet sweet baked goods, organic chocolate milk, fresh cheeses and the floors have been swept!
5. tables outside! i love outdoor seating... 
6. theres a wine and spirits near by... can we say wine and cheese date?

cons...
1. during the weekends its always packed with tourists so if u know where you have to go, get there fast and dodge the little children as safely as possible!
2. during lunch time the tables indoors are always packed! you have to hunt them down and wait patiently, get warm food at your caution.. be prepare to have warm soup.

If anyone asks me the question ""I'm coming to Philly, what is there to see and do?"" My number one answer would be Reading Terminal Market!

It is the perfect place for families, friends, couples, etc because you will be able to find something for everyone - even the pickiest eaters.

There are tons of places and kinds of foods to eat, in addition to a beer garden that allows takeout for those who are interested.

My favorite place to eat here is Meltkraft. I love the Melter Skelter, a grilled cheese with BBQ chips as one of its delicious ingredients. 

You can go here countless times and try something completely new and different each time. I also do groceries here as you can find fresh produce, meats, and more.

They have everything that you can imagine as far as food goes. Well almost everything, and even some things that are really not great as far as nutrition goes (chocolate covered cookie? Win! cheesecake brownie? Hell to the yes!) The only gripe I have about the place is that quite a few of the little stores inside have a fear of credit cards, or they set some high amount as the spending limit when using a credit card. Which is fine if you are planning on buying quite a bit of food, but it can suck when you're just trying to buy some sandwich meat. Have you ever bought $10.00 worth of sandwich meat? It goes a long way. I used to love oven roasted turkey at one point. 

I always find something new when I'm in there. Probably because every time I go in there, it's incredibly busy, so I kind of make my movements through the aisles based on the general mill of the crowd (yes, I am that lazy).

Upon seeing DiNics on a T.V. food channel, I made it a point to check out the Reading Terminal Market over the weekend. 

What can I say about the Reading Terminal Market?

Well, the best way to describe this place is - it's like a GIANT mega food court & store!!! 
You name it, they probably have it here...........all kinds of ethnic foods can be found here, as well as fresh farm produce, meats & poultry, finest seafood items, baked goods & confections.

My mission when I had visited the Reading Terminal Market was to try the sandwich from DiNics (which I accomplished), as I ended up eating both the roast pork, & roast beef sandwiches.............I really enjoyed both sandwiches, but between the two...........I gave the thumbs up to the roast pork!

While walking around the mall, I ran into another sandwich shop called - Carmen's Famous Italian Hoagie & Cheesesteaks. 
The time when I was there, I saw our island son - Barack Obama come to Carmen's to eat a cheese steak, so I figured if it was good enough for President Obama, it was a must for this island son to also give it a try too! Lol!

There is a very long history about the Reading Terminal Market, as I read a brochure about this place.............let me share a little of what I read.

Apparently back in 1892 the Reading Railroad opened the Reading Terminal Market below the tracks of their massive new train shed. The 78,000 sq. foot market held nearly 800 spaces for vendors & was touted as the ""greatest food market"" in the world!
By 1971, the Reading Railroad went bankrupt & the Reading Terminal Market started to decline & be in disrepair. 
Beginning in the 1980's, the Reading Company renewed attention to the market & began a turnaround of the facilities, and by 1984 trains stopped running to the station above the market and the city's commuter rail system was re-routed to bypass the old Reading Terminal. 
By 1990 the historic building was sold to the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority, who rebuilt the market to strict historic preservation standards, and also set up a non-profit management company to run the market and maintain the historical integrity of this place.

I must say, if you're ever in Philadelphia, take sometime to check out the  Reading Terminal Market, as you should put it in your ""must"" list of things to do! 
Visiting the market has a lot of very cool historical value, as well coming here to try the various types of food...........it's basically a foodie lovers paradise!!!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,51 N 12th St,"Candy Stores, Shopping, Department Stores, Fast Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Fruits & Veggies, Chinese, Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Seafood, Health Markets, Bagels, Cheese Shops, Shopping Centers, Chocolatiers & Shops, Meat Shops, Public Markets, Food Court, Wineries, Local Flavor, Ethnic Food, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Arts & Entertainment, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Seafood Markets, Farmers Market, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Food Stands, Dinner Theater, Sporting Goods, Grocery, Fashion",Philadelphia,39.9533414645,-75.1588545174,Reading Terminal Market,19107,5721,4.5,PA,1,1

RTM was founded in the 1890's, and has never closed since. About a third of the shops and eateries, bakeries, etc are owned and operated by Amish people. 

Three of the businesses at Reading Terminal Market have been run by the same families since the 1890's when the market originally opened. 

The Market used to be closed on Sundays (I assume) because of the Amish people, but a few years ago they decided to keep it open. So, you can go on Sundays, just expect about 1/3 of the businesses to be closed. 

Reading Terminal Market is where you go when you want to have a food experience that you can't have anywhere else other than Philly. As a local I can tell you this is where I take people just about every time if they have never been to my city. I take them to Cosmi's or John's Roast Pork later, once their RTM induced food coma has worn off.

I won't make any specific recommendations because EVERYTHING you can eat here is worthy of 5 stars. That's why it's great. You can walk around and sample all of this amazing food from all over the world and at the same time experience the TRUE definition of what it means to enjoy Philly's best.

This was my first stop in Philadelphia, fresh off the plane and having just had the chance to drop off luggage at my friend's house. All we knew was that we were hungry and also wanted to take in some sights. So we walked down the street and headed straight for the market. And this place was PACKED! I was not prepared for the onslaught of sights and sounds and choices. I had researched some things to try - such as the pretzels, donuts, and pork sandwich - but that barely scratched the surface of what this market has to offer. I mean, c'mon, chocolate noses! 

The first day, we tried the pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sweet pepper and it was quite tasty. Also loved the pretzel. The donuts were unique although not my favorite, but there are definitely so many to choose from you are bound to find something you enjoy - we tried the key lime, oreo creme, and sugar. 

The next day we needed a quick breakfast and had to stop by for famous scrapple and the hot apple dumpling. When it came down to a choice of adding heavy or whipped cream, I decided to be daring and go with some heavy cream and I have never been happier with my decision! That hot apple dumpling was one of my favorite things. And scrapple was unique. I ended up adding some syrup and enjoyed it. Definitely not something I get back home!

Beiler's has good donuts, but lines are long. 
Bassetts has good ice cream with lots of creamy flavors. 
Dutch eating place for apple dumplings. 
DiNics for a pork sandwich (personally not a fan but others like it). 
Kamal's Middle Eastern for a mint lemonade or some other fun and unique drink. 
Sang Kee for a duck fried rice.

At first it looked like an Amish market, but there were other things that set it apart. It wasn't a strictly Amish market type of place. I noticed Chinese and Middle Eastern offerings as well. The line for the ladies room was ridiculously long and the crowd at the market acts like they just sucked on a bag on rotten lemons, but I digress....the food made all of the hassle worth it.

I feel like this place sums up the Philly food scene pretty well, for me at least.

Due to the fact that I made the trek to Philly, I made sure that I was going to stuff my tummy to new levels of discomfort. I started at Dinic's. The line was long, but went by pretty quick. I settled for a pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe. It was pretty decent, I wouldn't cry to the sky over it, but I liked it. It set me back a little over $9...not the cheapest fast eat sandwich.

There is something about pretzels and Philly that really makes for a happy combo. I picked up a pretzel on my way out of the market...I'll review the pretzel place on its own....along with the Flying Monkey bakery.

3).  Grocery shopping and specialty foods
4).  Close to Jefferson Septa stop
5).  Restrooms

Cons:

2).  Super crowded!  If you can avoid bringing a stroller, do it!  Wait times for food can be almost an hour during peak times. 
3).  Not a lot of places to sit and eat. You have to stalk the tables and wait for someone to leave.

Things we tried:
1. Blueberry and apple fritters from Beiler's. Donuts usually rank a little lower than cookies for me if I'm in the mood for something carb-y and sweet but this really knocked all of our socks off. The Boston creme was way too sugary. 

2. Famous 4th Street Cookie Co. Incandescent. I took a bite and levitated a few feet off the ground. I think this even beats Levain for me. It was so unbelievable. I went back the next day for another (original chocolate chip no walnuts - and yes, they do have a version with walnuts).

3. A ginger shot from the stand selling ginger drinks. 

4. Smucker's jerky. We went there on consecutive days to pick up some more.

Beiler's is a conveniently located donut spot in the predominantly Amish section on the 12th street side closer to Arch street. My favorite donut(s) are the fritters, but particularly the blueberry one.

4th Street, the best cookie stop in the city IMO, is smack dab in front of the entrance at 12th and Filbert. These humongous cookies are sold by weight, but I pretty much always leave with at least 6 because getting to the counter is almost impossible some days. The peanut butter chocolate chip and regular chocolate chip are divine, but you can't really go wrong.

Now, coming back as an adult, I was able to appreciate Reading Terminal Market in all of its full glory. Over the past few years, fancy, often overpriced food halls have become more popular, but Reading Terminal Market embraced that concept years ago, and is quite reasonably priced. There are upwards of 30 vendors offering everything from meals to dessert to groceries and various Amish delicacies. It is always extremely crowded on weekends and at lunchtime on weekdays, so if you can go during off-peak times, you will have the best experience!

Why you hate it - it has a bad sushi display,it has a traditional diner that isn't open 24/7 (how does this exist), it's buffet section is kind of seedy, it has a horrible bar inside, Rick's Steaks moving out is going to kind of suck, there are 3 or 4 Chinese style stands and only one of them might be traditional.

Why You love it - incredible market atmosphere overall,The best Amish farmers section that's anywhere outside of Pennsylvania Dutch territory,  plenty of Authentic multicultural cuisines for inexpensive prices, piano music on the way to the bathroom, an incredible cooking book section, one of the best cheese stands ever, the fun events that take place, and the fact that Tony Luke's should be moving in could be amazing.

I like that there are a lot of grocery vendors, like seafood, produce, and tea, and not just food stalls. The offerings lean classic and fast food-y rather than super millennial or artisanal.

Lines for Philly cheese steaks are long but move quick; I don't think this is the place to try it unless you're on a speed-tour like I was, as I thought it was pretty average and the experience getting it was stressful. The donut place is a cool stop to see them making different pastries, though I thought the one we had was meh. An unexpected highlight was the infused olive oil and vinegar spot-- you have to try everything.

PROS:
- Multiple dining options! From Cajun dishes to homey soul food and delicious breakfast and brunch items, there is a little bit of everything for everyone.
- Moreover, there is always something new during your next visit! With all of the vendors inside, it is difficult to eat everything you see in one visit.
- $4 parking at 2 different garages for 2 hours! All you need to do is take your parking ticket, spend $10 at ONE vendor and have that place validate it for you before you return to your vehicle and pay.
- The vendors are all friendly. Smiles were abound and enticing dishes were everywhere to be found!

CONS:
- Crowded and touristy. I accidentally ""shouldered"" a high schooler (or middle schooler?) from out of town because of how crowded this place gets (and because he was hogging the aisle).
- The open seating area is limited. You have two options: Wait for a table to open up OR you could join one. Some vendors, like Molly Malloys, have their own seating area. My family and I were fortunate enough to grab a table after a few minutes of waiting and, seconds later, two people joined us at the table. I'm totally fine with this, but hopefully part of the ongoing construction includes additional seating areas.
- Lines, lines, lines! Everyone wants a taste of the delicious doughnuts at Beiler's or the famous Roast Pork Sandwich from DiNic's, so expect to wait awhile at the popular vendors/stalls.

All things considered, RTM is a great place to grab a bite or even shop for a few groceries! I love the idea of indoor markets and food halls, so visiting this place was a great experience.

If you've played Monopoly you've probably heard of the Reading Railroad.  In the late 1890s the Reading Terminal was built and used as a passenger train station and train depot.  But by the 1980s the building was no longer effective as a train terminal so the site was eventually repurposed, in part for the well-liked foodie market.  

Reading Terminal Market has over 100 vendors.  Some vendors are selling prepared foods while other are selling groceries, specialty items and gifts.  Meat, seafood, cheese, vegetables, chocolate and other goodies are plentiful here.  This place is a cacophony of sights, sounds and smells.  As a first timer I enjoyed methodically weaving my way through the market checking out all of the stalls.

Miller's Twist: get your hands on a breakfast pretzel log. I got one that was filled with bacon, cheese and egg and it was amazing. The pretzel was buttery, and the filling was warm and cheesy. I was there in the morning and there was definitely a line for these amazing breakfast logs. This spot is Amish owned too!

Sweet as Fudge Candy Shoppe: Another Amish owned business with lots of candy, and home made fudge. You can ask for samples of the fudge, which are made with real cream and butter!

Old City Coffee: Great place to grab coffee, they can also make your coffee fancy as they have a variety of syrups! They do sell coffee beans which you can take home.

Bassetts Ice Cream: This place has such amazing ice cream- I tried the strawberry which tasted like real fruit. The salted caramel pretzel was the bomb - vanilla ice with chocolate covered pretzels and caramel drizzle. This was soooo amazing.

1. Be prepared to embrace the crowds.  It's part of the Reading Terminal experience.  Think about it.  All those folks are there because the place is so amazing!

2. Don't visit on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday.  Why you ask?  There are over a dozen Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish) vendors that are definitely worth visiting.  They have special hours and don't open on these days.  It would be a mistake not to see them.

3. If you want the very best deals make sure you end your visit during the last hour of each day.  That would be between 5:00 and 6:00 PM Monday -Saturday and 4:00 to 5:00 PM on Sunday.

4. If you are a foodie be prepared to be overwhelmed, stunned, amazed, and generally blown away.  You won't be able to do it justice in two (2) hours.  Think three (3) or more.

5. Speaking of two (2) hours, it will cost you $4 for that amount of time at the 12th & Filbert garage.  All you need to do is spend $10 and any vendor will validate your ticket.  Even better is to not park at all and take public transportation.  

6. Check the website for cool events especially to see the live music schedule.  http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/events/

7. Some folks say the place is touristy and they are partially correct.  That's true of some of the vendors but anyone with half a brain can spot them in a second.  If that's not your thing just walk on by.

8. If you want to stay in the market and have an adult libation, check out Molly Malloy's.  It's a great place for a beer.

9. If you are thinking about lunch at prime time (11:30-1:00), please think again.  And then think again and again.  Trust me; it's complete and utter craziness.  Eat early or eat late.

10. Last but not least let's talk Tommy DiNic's as this legendary emporium deserves special mention.  I know, I know, you saw Man vs. Food and you want ""The Sandwich.""  Is it worth it?  Yeah, it is.  Stroll the market and stop back occasionally to check on the length of the line.  If you see it below twenty five (25) folks, go for it.  It really is an amazing sandwich.

As just about everyone says this place is a must for a Philly visitor.",Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ,51 N 12th St,"Candy Stores, Shopping, Department Stores, Fast Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Fruits & Veggies, Chinese, Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Seafood, Health Markets, Bagels, Cheese Shops, Shopping Centers, Chocolatiers & Shops, Meat Shops, Public Markets, Food Court, Wineries, Local Flavor, Ethnic Food, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Arts & Entertainment, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Seafood Markets, Farmers Market, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Food Stands, Dinner Theater, Sporting Goods, Grocery, Fashion",Philadelphia,39.9533414645,-75.1588545174,Reading Terminal Market,19107,5721,4.5,PA,1,1

I normally order they in Miami with onions, peppers, mushrooms and I find that to be quite tasty but is it an authentic Philly cheese steak? I don't know. 

Anyway, we arrived here Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy but the line moved quickly. We ordered four cheese steaks with provolone cheese. I messed up and forgot to order fries. I was pretty bummed about that, they looked delicious. 10 minutes later they called our name and we were all really excited to dig in and it was just... ok. The sandwiches were kinda cold and I thought they were dry as well. I didn't think it was anything to write home about. I actually only ate half of my sandwich and when I arrived home that night, I added some mayo and warmed it up in the microwave and it was a lot better.

One sultry Monday afternoon, I had to pick up a package from the UPS on Oregon Avenue.  I live in West Philadelphia, and it's extremely difficult to get to South Philly from West Philly using public transportation so I asked my friend to drive me there, on the condition that I buy her a something to eat.  On the way there, we spotted Tony Luke's and considered eating there after getting my package. We spent the longest time in an unairconditioned, crowded, totally inefficient UPS, and the last thing I wanted in 100 degree weather was a hot sandwich.  But the foodspotting app on my phone was completely overtaken by photos of Tony Luke's sandwiches, so I had little choice but to give in.  

Since we decided to split a sandwich so we had to agree on which one to order.  I was so disappointed by my first roast pork sandwich, and I had just had it two days ago, so I was rooting for the veal cutlet.  My friend desperately wanted roast pork, and I asked a guy in front of us (I got the feeling he knew what he was doing) what he recommended, and he had tried everything (I was right) and loved the roast pork.  We received our food pretty quickly, even though not right when we ordered it like at Pat's and Geno's.  Tony Luke's didn't seem to have the same assembly line operation as those two, which gives me more of the feeling that the sandwiches are ~made with love~.  But that's probably just me...

But anyways, Tony Luke's completely redeemed the roast pork sandwich in my mind.  With that single first bite, any previous notions of roast pork as unimpressive, not flavorful, and dry quickly vanished.  For about $9, we ordered the roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone (the same exact thing I ordered at DiNic's) and I almost put hot peppers on it, thinking I had learned from my last experience.  But this time, it didn't need anything.  The sandwich was divine.  So juicy, so much flavor, the broccoli rabe was not bitter and the sharp provolone was slighly melted and not overpowering at all.  I was told by the guy in front of me that the roast pork was spicy, which it wasn't really, but it did have a little kick and my mouth felt a little bit tingly from it.  It was so unbelievably delicious, and not just because my first roast pork sandwich was bad...that just required the Tony Luke's sandwich to be extraordinary to make up for it.  And it certainly did.

It's really hard to make it out to Tony Luke's without a car, but I hope I can return.  It's definitely worth the trip.",sf8YN3OhUUXWzjdm9dAgFA,39 E Oregon Ave,"Sandwiches, Fashion, Used, Vintage & Consignment, Cheesesteaks, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Shopping",Philadelphia,39.9141065086,-75.1487272304,The Original Tony Lukes,19148,1910,4.0,PA,1,1

Flash forward to our latest visit:  We pull into the parking lot of the new (ish) location and spot a trio of porta potties.  ""Must be for construction workers, "" I reassure myself.  Alas, no.  This spot is BARE BONES.   Not only are there no ""normal"" restrooms, it is counter service only, with just a few random tables with bench (read: no back support) seating.  On the sweltering day we visited, there was also no ac.  Not the best way to begin, and honestly, had we known ahead of time, we would not have eaten here. The Tony Luke's we remembered had a casual, but comfortable ambience that we were looking forward to for a relaxing dinner.  This place...Not so much.

At any rate, on to the sandwiches.  Kid and I both got the classic Cheesesteak with American and Fried Onions.   Meat was nice and tender, but a little bland to me.  In hindsight, I should have added roasted long, hot peppers, an option for extra $ on the menu.  Afterward, I noticed a little condiments stand that included hot cherry peppers, but they were whole, making them awkward to eat in a sandwich. Hubby got the Roasted Pork with Provolone and Broccoli Rabe.  Since he had bad flashbacks of eating and hating pungent melted sharp provolone the last time we were here, he swapped it out for a mild version of the cheese.  I don't think it came even close to the South Philly-inspired Roast Pork sandwich from Federoff's in Brooklyn, but it hit the spot.

The Background:  En route from San Francisco to Montreal for a bachelor party.  The bachelor and one of the other travel companions when to school in Philly and suggested we head for a cheesesteak during our three hour layover at PHI.  We landed at 6am and were at Tony Luke's by 6:30.

The Experience:  We go up to the window and three of us order cheesesteaks and the other orders the pork italian.  Bad news, too early for the pork italian and it is going to be a 45 minute wait.  4th decides to go for cheesesteak.  All are satisfied.

Four cheesesteaks consumed, the 4th goes back to order the pork italian.  The four of us split the second round.  Even more satisfied.

Back to the airport:  OK, so taking a cab to Tony Luke's probably isn't the best idea we've ever had.

A couple of bites later, they were lying crumbled at my feet, victims of popular knowledge and misinformation. Oh, how wrong I was! Wrong, wrong, wrong! 

For instance: the meat on a cheesesteak does NOT need to include bits of gristle and fat. It can be lean, meltingly tender and packed with flavor. It can also include roast pork in addition to beef: I don't really even like pork, but this was so delicious I think I'd have to do some soul-searching before placing my next steak order.

Or: the idea that cheesesteaks must include plastic cheese to be authentic. In my former ignorance I held to this heresy, but at Tony Luke's I was peer-pressured into ordering sharp provolone instead, and the sandwich came full of melty, creamy goodness, but without any of the petroleum-byproduct tinniness from the can -- just biting, pungent cheese flavor in blistered bubbles of perfection.

And that other pesky ideal, that cheesesteaks are best enjoyed plain? Only true if the add-ons are as mediocre as they usually are. Here, you can get the requisite fried onions, which lend a smoky flavor to the sandwich, but you can also order broccoli rabe, which has been stewed to remove any bitterness and adds a juicy, fresh depth. Oh, my, it was delicious. 

The one thing I remain convinced of is that the bread makes the sandwich.

I had hit DiNics at noon (see my review here at Yelp), gone and did the Clinic I was in town to do, and now, It was time for dinner. At the Enterprise Rentacar desk at the Airport, the Gent there advised only the tourists went to Geno's or Pat's for Cheesesteaks. Locals go to Tony Lukes.
But I couldn't visit Philly and not at least TRY to go to that famous corner, which is smack dab in the middle of a claustrophobic residential neighborhood. Nowhere to park, and lines at both places like those you find at Disneyland. I wanted to grab a picture, but the traffic was so dense, I couldn't even do that. Rats!
So Tony Luke's it was!
There are a few Tony Luke's in town, but I'm all about OldSchool, so only the original would do. In an industrial part of town which has prolly seen better days, I kluged a parking spot (i was driving a hot black gorgeous brand-new Chrysler 300c) adjacent to TL's, under the freeway, with a few unsavory-looking Youths nearby. Maybe I shoulda swung with a safer location, but it was getting late. I would tough it out. There was a modest line, and the pic-a-nic tables were jammed. This wadn't a-gonna be easy! I did do a little reconnoiter as how to order at TL's. and for me it was a Cheesesteak whiz wit'. I also called an audible when I saw ""Italian Pork with Broccoli Rabe and Provolone"" on the Menu. I took my two torpedo-sized Sarnies to a table that had miraculously cleared as I approached. (the Philly Food Gods must have been on my side, as the same thing happened earlier that day at DiNics!) As I sat down, a funky and zaftig young gal moseyed over with her own torpedo. ""Mind if I sit with you?"" to which I answered ""Sure!"". She sat down and tore into her Cheesesteak with lusty abandon. This was going to be fun! I pounced upon my cheesesteak, and it was tasty indeed. Kinda sloppy-this is not something I'd want to eat in the Chrysler. 
All-in-all the Cheesesteak wasn't neck-and-neck with the DiNic's sarnie I scarfed earlier in the day. If I hadn't gone to DeNic's I would be jumping up and down over the TonyLuke's Cheesesteak, but it was kinda like an Italian Beef without the Giardinera. The Gal across the table identified herself as the Former Culinary director of Barnum and Bailey's Circus. She certainly knew how to eat. I et half of my Cheesestaek and turned my attention to TonyLuke's Roast Pork.
Jumping Jesus-This sarnie blew away DiNics! Great garlic note, tangy greens, and an explosion of Flavor. This was the über-Philly experience I had been waiting for.
The Circus gal said that Tony Luke's was far and away the top dog in town for these sarnies, I had to agree. I dispatched the entire thing, waddled back to the Chrysler, bidding Circus Gal adieu.

The customer service is probably the worst I have ever experienced.  We walked up to the window and the lady stared blankly in front of her like she didn't see us.  That's what I thought, until I realized she just had a horrible attitude and wasn't going to acknowledge us until we started to order.  Similar rudeness occurred throughout the entire experience.  It boggles my mind that the Tony Luke's establishment thinks this woman's attitude is an acceptable attitude for one of their employees to have, much less one who is working in a customer service role.  

The food is common street food that you can get anywhere in Philly.  Please, do not drive down to south Philly and wait in a hour line for some regular ass Philly food.  There wasn't much of a line when went there, so we figured we'd check it out.  I ordered a fish sandwich with pickles and lettuce.  The menu said it came with tartar sauce, but my sandwich had none on it.  It came on a huge, very hard hoagie roll. Why? No one wants a fish hoagie.

In this case, the first time I went I was immediately a fan. I've NEVER had a bad cheesesteak at Tony Lukes; ever. What backs up the palatte pleasure is the sheer craziness of the atmosphere. You park in the middle of the street (more fun if you show up on say a Saturday in the middle of the night when the 'crazies' are out); order a delicious sandwich without fear of 'screwing up' like you do at Pats, you grab a seat in the very clean and appointed seating area and sometimes you even get to see Ben Franklin. No joke. You meet all kinds of people, it's fun. 

Recently we went a little crazy and visited Pats, Genos and Tony Lukes all in one day (hey we were there for a hockey game, why not...you gotta eat right?). Location wise Tony Lukes wins, food quality yup, Tony Lukes again, and definitely Tony Lukes for customer service and overall experience. 

I enjoyed my provolone/wit at Pats but the bread was a little dry and thick, nothing wrong with that....but then again I can bake bread at home so I'd prefer a little less when I'm after a cheesesteak. The location is totally sketchy but because you have so many tourists going to Pats and Genos it's a little less intimidating...well; in a philly the city of not-brotherly love kind of way. 

Genos - fugheddaboudit; yuck. All I have to say. The food, the customer service (or lack thereof) and the experience. Never again...but now I can speak from experience instead of theory and hearsay.

If you get a Cheesesteak with ""whiz"", then you're wasting your time and their good ribeye meat.

""Whiz"" is the salty cheap-ass stuff street vendors put on steaks because it's super-cheap and doesn't take up space or require refrigeration. So a whiz steak at TL's will taste like the same whiz steak at Pat's, Geno's, Jim's or Abner's. Nothing special, you could have stayed home and poured Kraft Mac & Cheese sauce over some Dinty Moore stew instead. Or you could go to Le Bec Fin and order instant oatmeal.

Get what TL's does best: Italiano style sandwiches with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone... Even better, get the roast pork or roast beef, since they have a nice lightly peppery & garlicky au jus that soaks the bread and makes it messy and delicious.

Whiz is for tourists and people who don't know better... Just forget it even exists.

Yes, you'll wait in line to order & pick up... Yes, you'll pay cash (c'mon, it's a Cheesesteak stand!)... Yes, you may have trouble getting a seat. Oh, well, such is life sometimes.

When two guys eat, that's the best compliment that you can give the chef.  It's the sign that the men are focusing on the food, and how good it tastes and not on other things, like girls, sports, or technology. Tony Luke's was good, but not enough to deserve an ""absolute silence"" status.

For me, growing up in philly, I have been craving a philly cheese steak
since the last time I visited.  Tony Luke's hit the spot, however,
I'm surprised at the over 75 ratings of 5 stars. Yes it's delishious,
but it's not great.  Like all authentic philly places, cheese steaks come with cheese wiz.  I thought the ""wiz"" started solidifying halfway through my sandwich, and that there was not enough meat.

Oh, and check out my pix, a dude took the 5 lb cheesesteak sandwich challenge (eat within an hour and you get it for free, plus a picture on the ""hall of fame"".  That is a monster of a cheesesteak.

Overall, I would give this cheesesteak a 7/10.  If you have options,
check out either: abners, jim's, or chinks (yes I'm asian and i find that name funny).

There aren't many choices in South Philly besides Wendys, McD's, and the sandwich carts. I always leave a little disappointed.

This was our last stop of the weekend of sampling cheesesteaks.   It's actually not 'sampling' since we did manage to eat a whole cheesesteak at each of the places we visited.

The benefits of eating at Tony Luke's include:  ample parking, indoor seating, and friendly staff.   The reason for the #1 spot is that their meat was tender, the 'wiz' was plentiful and really complimented the sandwich.  I'd prefer a dryer 'bread' but the wiz and the meat really came out on the bread.   The size of the sandwich appeared to be much larger than our previous dining experiences.

I bumped it up a notch and added mushrooms and just a tiny portion of onions.   The wiz was perfect on this sammie.   Since this was 'breakfast', I stuffed myself with about half of this tube of goodness before we ventured back into the car for the 2.5 hour drive home.

I admit I stumbled with my order but the guy at the window was patient and helped me along.

We got our order within a few minutes, and it was enjoyable and there was nothing to complain about. Better than steak'um by far, and definitely better than any of the cheesesteaks in Virginia. The frank fries were a bit salty if the hot dog slivers had been chicken I think it would have been enjoyable.

Then it was off to Pat's and Geno.

Pat's and Geno was an assembly line of cheesesteaks ready to feed the masses.

Pat's was chopped up ribeye like I was used to and by far had the healthiest portion of beef. Geno's was lacking in the portions department.

The next day I hopped in the car and headed to Sout Philly.  I have to admit...I was very disappointed.  For my taste the fresh baked bread isn't right for a cheesesteak and that was the biggest let down.

Roast Pork Italiano - be prepared to lick the wrapper once there's no sandwich left.  That goes for almost everything they make there.

We ordered the usual one night and decided to get some onion rings as well (which of course are awesome).  When we grabbed our sandwiches, they forgot the onion rings and we went back up to get them.  Cashier said, ""Gimme the receipt and your bag.""  She then investigatively searched our bag, threw it back to us and slammed down an order of onion rings.  All I could think of was, ""Holy shit, this lady just bitched me up.  What a crazy ass!""  But maybe that's me and maybe that's just how it is at Tony Luke's.  Is it a trademark attitude they have there?  Like, is that what makes ""Tony Luke's"" and I'm too blind to see?

I'd first heard of this place from Tony Bruno on ESPN Radio. After hearing all his comments about the broccoli rabe and reading all the reviews, I was primed to eat here.

They actually have two Tony Luke's, one's a sit outside/order at a window type deal and the other is what looks like a sit down restaurant across the street. I came around noon and ordered from the sidewalk/order at the window joint. 

I got the roast pork italian, which has sharp provolone and your choice of spinach or broccoli rabe(I got the rabe). I also got an order of fries.  The sandwich came out relatively fast along with the fries. There was a mixup on my soda, but I got it, so no harm no foul.  I sat down at one of the aluminium tables next to the order window with my sandwich. The roast pork sandwich was so so good. The combination of the provolone and the broccoli rabe really complimented the tender pork slices.  My mouth is starting to water again just reading about it. The fries were not too bad and there were plenty of them. I""m not sure whether they were breaded or it was the potatoes they used, but it seemed a little different.  Next time I think I'll get the onion rings. 

I did have one beef with Tony Luke's. I wasn't happy however with the cleanliness of the eating area and on top of that there were multiple flies buzzing around. I know that you can't completely wipe out mother nature, but I can't help but think if they'd cleaned the place and took out the garbage more often that maybe there wouldn't have been so many flies.

Overall I enjoyed the food. I'll come back and take the sandwiches back home.

So we bundled up against the cold weather and criss-crossed through various neighborhoods as he told me the history of Philadelphia, and shared some stories about growing up in the Italian neighborhoods of South Philly.

During our journey we drove past both Pat's and Geno's, and no telling how many other famous emporiums of cheesesteak goodness as we cruised along the major thoroughfares. Finally he parks the car on a side street, under the highway, and we march around the corner to find ourselves standing in front of the original location of Tony Luke's. Now Frank has not led me wrong all week with his recommendations for places to eat, so I was certainly psyched to try a real Philly cheesesteak.

I was freezing my niblets off in the very cold weather (after all I'm from Florida, and this frozen tundra crap is someone else's idea of fun), but sure enough we stood in line - OUTSIDE - while waiting for our turn to place our order. The menu is pretty straight forward... you have roast beef, roast pork, veal cutlet, chicken cutlet, chicken steak or rib-eye sandwiches along with a couple of other options for vegetarians and seafood lovers. At Frank's urging I ordered a Roast Beef Italian with Provolone and grilled onions and a side of onion rings.

HOLY WOW!!!! I'm not the kind of guy to say that one South Philly cheesesteak is better than another, and then have some sort of fight-to-the-death over bragging rights. I'm just going to say that this food was awesome -- tender, tasty, and flat out amazing.

Tony Luke's and John's Roast Pork cheesesteaks offers the most quantity of ribeye steak per cheesesteak compared to the other famous cheesesteak joints (Jim's, Pats, Genos, and Delassandros).  the cut of their ribeye steak is tender with no stringy texture, making for an enjoyable experience.  At Tony Luke's, they put minimal seasoning on their cheesesteaks, leaving it up to you as the customer to add however much salt, pepper, ketchup, or hot sauce you desire.  

a big plus is that they do not charge for additional vegetables added to your cheesesteak such as fried onions and mushrooms.  another huge plus compared to the other cheesesteak joints is that they take credit card and not just cash alone! the place is easily accessible with a big parking lot attached as well as ample street parking.  another solid cheesesteak joint in Philly to enjoy if you are nearby!",rjDuYaK41di3_CKioCHXLA,39 E Oregon Ave,"Sandwiches, Fashion, Used, Vintage & Consignment, Cheesesteaks, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Shopping",Philadelphia,39.9141065086,-75.1487272304,The Original Tony Lukes,19148,1910,4.0,PA,1,1

ATMOSPHERE:
Covered, open-air lanai seating along a noisy street.  Obnoxiously and incorrectly pronounced customer names over the PA on max volume.  Bathrooms are port-a-potties and there's no where to wash your hands.  Do takeout to enjoy your meal.  

MENU:
Breakfast sandwiches, hot & cold sandwiches, a variety of fries, onion rings, chicken fingers. 

FOOD:
Pork Italian - $9.00
I opted for sharp provolone for an additional $0.50 and chose spinach as my green.  It was good but nothing spectacular.  Soft bread that absorbed the pork juices, overly generous amount of tender and juicy pork slices and sharp cheese that added a nice zing.  The sliced pickles were the perfect accompaniment.  Not as messy a job that I had anticipated. 

SERVICE:
Much is to be desired at yet another Philly establishment that treats you like they're doing you a favor by being there.  On a small positive, it was a much more relaxing experience than ordering at Pat's.

As we sat, a worker in charge of clearing tables also brought over a tray full of condiments from the counter - pickle slices, salt, pepper, chili peppers and ketchup.  A nice touch but a waste of inventory as many things went into the trash. 

When my name was hollered over the PA, I went to the pick up window.  Employee Gina C. asks if I'm Vince.  Yes, I say.  Receipt?  Might have more than one Vince, she says.  As I fetch my receipt from our table, she annoyingly shouts over the PA ""HAVE YOUR RECEIPTS READY!?""  Really?  As I'm waiting for my food to be retrieved, I noticed a motivational sign on the wall behind the register stating ""Stop being mean to customers!"" with pouty emojis.  What a waste of paper its printed on. .  

TIPS:
Have your receipt ready when picking up your food unless you want to be shamed over the PA system. 

Bring handy wipes. 

Thankfully no tipping was necessary even with card payments.

It had been a while since I've been here. I gave them a shot today. 

Whatever was not true then may be true now. 

This wasn't a bad cheesesteak. There's nothing wrong with it. But I've had a lot of different cheesesteaks in town since I last had an original Tony Luke. 

And now I'm noticing that the beef flavor just doesn't sit the same way here as other places. I'm noticing that it seems saltier with the cheese. I'm noticing that the flavors don't seem to marry as well as other places. I'm noticing that it seems to be a little greasier than others. 

There's nothing wrong with Tony Luke's. They have many great sandwiches. The rolls are wonderful. 

But as of today, they've fallen out of my top 10 in the city. There's newer places and classic places just doing this sandwich better right now.

and even that maybe too much.

Am I eating the same cheesesteak that everyone else is?

Plain & simple - this isn't philly good.  It's ""philly bad"".  
  
It was god awful.  The best cheesesteaks are the ones that are chopped up, but the more touristy spots, such as this one, tend to just cook the steakmeat as is.  Fine whatever.  

The meat was so bland that the cheesesteak was lifeless (and this is coming from someone who prefers salt-less food). The meat was tough and chewy - this is top sirloin meat? I don't think so.  They don't use amoroso rolls, but a tougher thicker, slightly more hearty roll.

The fries came in a cute paperbox container - which is fun but the fries were disgusting.  Most of the fries were brown than a crispy yellow.  It has a tough coat and just wasn't yummy.  It was like eating little sticks of brown grease.  The oil either needed to be changed out or they overfried - probably both.

You are better off going to just about anywhere else to get a better cheesesteak. Seriously, anywhere else. 

Don't believe the hype just because it was on Food Network.

There is a station to get your napkins & condiments: ketchup, mustard, pickles. Also, a few bench tables for you to sit and eat there or wait for your order.

I tried to order a rib eye cheesesteak and roast beef cheesesteak.  As soon as I said roast beef, the lady scoffed at me, that's cold cuts!!!  you want cheesesteak or cold cuts???? so she basically told me not to order something featured prominently on the menu.  uuuuh oookk..... thrown off, I quickly changed to chicken.  Then she said something along the lines of ""oh now your changing it up on me"". uuuh my bad!!  She could have just let me order what I ordered, or if it's no good take it off the menu?  sorry to hold up your line!!

No biggie.  Another thing, they have huge signs saying something along the lines of we're busy, be sure to check that your order is right (don't remember the exact wording).  Fair enough, and they definitely gave me fries without cheese as I ordered, but I didn't have the nerve to go back and ask for cheese after showing my inaptness at ordering a cheesesteak properly!  

Now to the actual cheesesteaks, they had potential, but just were not that great.  I think I should not have said no to onions, I figured it would be so awesome it didn't matter either way but I was wrong.  There was just not enough flavor with just steak and cheese.  The chicken cheesesteak was not that good either, figures, I guess I wasn't supposed to order that either.  Probably the best thing was the bread, that tasted perfect.

About the cheese, I tried american and provolone, the provolone (i think) was just not enough flavor, the american ok but not great.  I have heard cheese wiz is popular on philly cheesesteaks and my gf said she had it before with the cheese wiz and it was better.  I am just not a big fan of cheese wiz, and couldn't process why I would want cheese out of a can when I can get real cheese.

I tried De'Allessandro's last time I was in Philly and it was the best I've ever had.  I decided to try Tony Luke's this time.  The place is located on an industrial-ish looking street and I couldn't really find the parking lot so I parked on the street.  The inside is pretty old and bare bones.  It's pretty crowded and the metal tables aren't comfortable.  The service from the workers I interacted with was pretty 'order your food and get out' status.  However, there was this older black brother working there who asked me if I wanted hot peppers.  I declined, but that was nice of him to ask.  He was also singing like Marvin Gaye as he was going about his work.  I thought that was cool.

I got a cheesesteak ($9.75) with whiz and fried onions and a soda ($2.25).  Total came out to $12.69.  I was kind of disappointed looking at the cheesesteak when it came out because it wasn't nearly as meaty as the one I got from De'Allesandro's.  But the bread they used at Tony Luke's seemed nice.  I also made the choice of getting cheese whiz because I read that is how you're supposed to get it (I got swiss at De'Allesandro's).  I think getting whiz was a mistake though.  It wasn't too bad, but tasted a little too artificial for my liking.  Also they put a little too much of it on the sandwich.  The onions were good.  I have to say there was definitely an addictiveness to the steak at Tony Luke's (maybe all the oil) and it was definitely uniquely satisfying.  

All in all, the cheesesteak was definitely good but it could have been much more meatier and the cheese whiz took away from it a bit.  The price was also OK but not great.  This was a hard decision between 3 or 4 stars but I'm going with 3 cause the experience was a little uncomfortable (what I said about the interior and also factoring in the gruffness from the workers that I interacted with except for Marvin Gaye).

A group of four parked beneath a nearby overpass and left a party of two to mind the wheels while we trekked a slow-paced queue from the front door, through the back corner, to the front corner until finally - the order window.

Being the sandwich that defines a city, downing at least one whiz wit is standard practice. That said, it's impossible to pass up the allure of a roast pork with broccoli rabe and provolone, so my pahdna-in-grime and opted to split the two 'wiches in a battle royale.

And in this corner, PIG AND PLANT.

Less than four minutes later, the victor emerged, well, victorious. Call it blasphemy, but the cheesesteak didn't hold a candle to the roast pork. Too little whiz over near flavorless, shaved and oil-slicked steak left me bumming, only to be reinvigorated by the sharp provolone, bitter rabe and juicy brined pork. Fantastic bread is a push; the fight goes to PIG.

I also scored some handmade candles in cute little jars from Carnival Candle Co. Since I bought those, I have also ordered more to have sent to me since they come in various scents that I adore! 

There is also live music outdoors, street performers, and the Historic Jazz Society is also nesteled into the French Market.

I love checking out the unique finds that can't be found in your average souvenir shop. The French Market, unfortunately, didn't quite do it for me.

So the Market is split into two parts, food and gifts. I'll review them separately.

The food section is great! Food stalls are abundant, serving local grub like gumbo, jambalaya, alligator, and oyster. Come hungry and be ready to try a bunch of goodies. There are also shops for you to buy packaged food items to go, like spices, sauces, alligator jerky, and baked goods. But mind you, the prices for these items are higher than you would find outside of the Market. I'm not sure why that is....

The gift section of the Market was a huge disappointment. I was expecting to find unique gifts to bring home, but most of the items for sale were low-quality, made-in-China trinkets I would never want to waste space in my suitcase on. And the kicker is that most of the items weren't even inexpensive! A t-shirt or a necklace will run about $20+ each.

I walked up and down left right up and down.  What caught my attention when I walk in was the big Ferris wheel inside.  Only thing close to this I have seen are malls in Hong Kong where they have roller coasters inside.

They even have a Daytona Nascar game with the actual car with actuators and pumps to simulate the real thing... just WOW.

Any person who likes sports outdoors will love this place... AMAZING.

They have all these wild animals with the heads stuff in the gunning area and these fake environmental mountains with dead animals that are real and stuffed...  On top of that they have the famous presidents in wax and when you press a button it talks about some history stuff... i wasn't patient enough to sit through one since there was so much to see.

Everywhere I walk I saw someone holding a bag with Scheels and I wonder what it was.

Overall, amazing store for sport fanatics and outdoors. you'll get an orgasm from this place.  I  heard that their soft serve ice cream is good too.  I need to try that next time.

We are from sunny southern California but here in Reno there was snow on the ground! We had to get spikes or else he would not be able to run without slipping.  We tried several stores in the area but they were all sold out of spiked shoes in his size as well as something called Yaktraks.  So one of the guys who worked at Cabela's told us to give Scheels a try.

We first walked in and it was an amazing store for a sporting goods.  It felt like a large department store but with registers at the front doors like a Target.  So I gotta tell you that yes, they had running shoes with spikes in his size and the Yaktraks.  We got there just in time because it was the last pair of spikes.  Apparently all the coaches were calling and buying products for the snowy race.  One team reserved 90 bags of the actual metal spike bags for themselves.  A young man by the name of Spencer assisted us and did a great job explaining things to us.  He's originally from Iowa and is used to running in the snow.  With his help we picked up a couple more Yaktraks for other team members.  

But what we loved about this store is that it is fun.  They have two large, I'm talking floor to ceiling aquariums filled with live fish swimming around.  You can walk underneath and in between its arches to get a close up view of them.  My kids loved it!  Next they had a full size ferris wheel in the middle of the store!  I thought at first it was just a model but it was actually in operation.  My kids really thought that was neat to ride one inside a store.  My younger boy got his first ride on a ferris wheel at Scheels. And it was only a dollar and for that he not only had a great experience but the guy operating it made it fun.  He has such a good demeanor with the public he was the perfect guy for the job.   

When my older boy went for his ride the first day he saw mannequins on the second floor of U.S. presidents.  So we went up there to view them.  They were on display and you depressed a button and an actor's voice would speak in the president's stead.  They also had a written description of each president's accomplishments.  That was a good idea to put all of this there as it got us to go upstairs.  Now I know that they have large areas for golf, guns, airsoft guns, equipment and hunting clothing.  

After first going that Friday with my older son to get his running shoes/spikes we thought that it was neat that we went back the next day with my younger boy. On that day there was even more fun as they had a live musical marathon where children of various ages were playing classical, holiday and movie theme music on various instruments such as the piano, violin and cellos.  It was very enjoyable as they played so well.  

We also told friends about it.  One of them said that on their way out of town they stopped by to enjoy the store.  That friend said that it was going to probably cost him money because his wife likes to shop and she found some neat things to buy.

This is written in August 2021 where masks are enforced by the state of Nevada for all indoor venues. But they aren't enforcing it in their place. They are violating a state mandate. Such a shame considering that this place was 5-stars for me before the pandemic. There are so many fun venues in this huge store and I enjoy it. But their lack of care for COVID safety is what drops this place three stars for me in this time. I don't care about what beliefs or opinions the people running this store have on mask mandates. Safety and public health comes first. 

It's not Scheels' fault that customers are not wearing masks, but if they are not enforcing health regulations and adhering to state mandates, it will be their downfall in the pandemic.

Unless this pandemic completely ends, if you truly care about your safety with COVID, don't shop here. I haven't seen many Yelpers touch upon this issue (given the recent mandates as of this post), so I thought to address it here. They should be enforcing these things in this time.

EDIT: I am giving one star back since the service there id very good. I particularly want to shout out Casey, Cole and Paschence for being very passionate team members that helped me look for stuff.

From the time you walk into this store your welcomed by cashiers and then what is my favorite thing in the store is a marvelous looking double arch fish tank now this is the same on either entrance but let me tell you a secret to know what side is to the rest of the shopping center or to the parking lot. Theres two tanks but if you didnt know theres a fresh water/ Salt water fish in one an vice versa. Beautifully made and sometimes you can even see a guy in scuba gear cleaning the units. Pretty awesome! Not to mention Scheels has a Full size Ferris wheel in the center of the Store. Now onto a few areas I liked and that I think needs some improvements. 

** Fishing Area **

Depending on when and what time you go, can vary if you'll have a great time or a bad time. So I mostly go to Scheels cause my wife an I love to fish so every week we go to buy a fishing lure, now when i was looking for a particular looking lure i approached a young and asked ""Excuse me, but do you have the Savage Gear Suicide Duck Lure? He then points me into the direction of the hunting equipment, Not! What I was wanting so I was kinda irritated and went to another part of the store an was looking for a manager because I was not pleased with what the young guy an girl were trying to say to me as for what I was looking for ""Ducks aren't used in this area for fishing"" was what they tried to tell me, the bad thing is I showed them the item on my phone via their website. Manager knew what I had talked about an was able to help me out promptly.

** Sporting gear * Team Apparel **

While looking for my favorite teams from Houston, the Texans, the Rockets an the 2017's World Series Champions the Houston Astros. I first glanced around the store til I was approached by a manager of the area and he asked ""Hi, how can I help you"" I told him I was looking for gear for my favorite teams so first ones he's like ""Texans? Sorry we don't carry them they are out of our district. Rockets? Yeah again out of our district, an so I was kinda like wow! Why am I here. So since it was a few months after the World Series i was thinking maybe some merchandise would be a little lower price and so i asked hey do you have any WS championship merch an he walks me over to the baseball section an shows me 7 racks of LA tshirts an one shirt from the event and i asked any Astro gear, no sorry they are out of the district. I'm stunned and now just bummed out I was turning around an the manager was like ""Hey man you can order it online"", and without hesitation I then asked ""then why have a store??""

Believe it or not I have come here for field trips. This store is an educators dream as you can shop and educate at the same time. 

Some history: Scheels began as a hardware and general mercantile store in 1902 from a German immigrant who used his first $300 dollars that he earned from his potato farm to open his first store. It is now employee-owned and operated. The store didn't see sporting goods until 1954. 

Between all the sporting equipment on the second floor are 14 animatronic U.S. Presidents that give their famous speeches. The amount of information from the Presidents alone is astounding. Not to mention the huge selection of taxidermy animals usually with information on the animal and genus. Tons of information here. Some of the coolest fish tanks full of fish.

Scheel's bike department not only sells bikes, but they offer bike service as well.  The adjustment did not quite fix my bike issue, but not for lack of trying from the service people.  They were very accommodating and went out of their way to make it work.  Finally, we decided I may need a new bike (wheeeee!!!) and that's where Bruce comes in.  He is friendly, knowledgeable and had excellent customer service skills.  He assessed my height, my preferences, and what I intend to use the bike for ~ trail riding? NO, street riding? Maybe.  Just ride around the neighborhooh? YES!  He then picked a bike off the rack, and had me test-ride it around the block.  He spoke a lot about technical stuff about the bike, but frankly, I tuned him out.  That's why I brought hubby, so he can pay attention to these things.

He took the time to explain the similarities and the differences between the two and told me to take my time in deciding which one.  He was surprisingly not pushing the sale, which I appreciated.  I would've taken my chosen bike with me, except I didn't like the color.  He encouraged us to shop around and advised us what to look for when shopping at other places.  Very cool.  Overall, we were very pleased with our experience with Bruce.  If it's a toss up between Scheel and somewhere else, or if the difference in price is not significant, I'll gladly bring my business to him at Scheels.  So, if you're in the market for a new bike, or for bike-related services, check out Scheels, and look for Bruce.

When I was bored last Wednesday night, I decided to drive over to check it out.  At first, I thought it was just an ordinary mall with a few nicer stores.

That's even bigger than the infamous Mall of America which is 2.5M SF.  It houses over 400 stores and restaurants on three levels, including seven department store anchors, though one of them is currently vacant.  

MY EXPERIENCE:  
The last time I was here, the mall was oddly located in two separate buildings and quite far from each other.  But, they've recently added a connector wing full of shops to make this mall a single behemoth.   Because the mall is so large, some stores have more than one location.  Maneuvering through the mall can be quite a task as its laid out like city blocks so you'll find yourself circulating the central core along with discovering hidden pockets.  Parking was plentiful but hard to come by due to massive crowds at the time we were there.  Aside from the plethora of shops we browsed through, my stomach is what matters on any vacation, in which it was made happy at The Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen.

There is also a separate mall that is somewhat interconnected through a walkway. The food court in the old part needs to be updated a bit with better lighting and possibly more seating.

Just to clarify a misconception...this is in fact the BIGGEST mall in all of America in terms of retail square footage...the Mall of America is bigger overall, but they have tons of other crap that is not retail related. Look it up.

That isn't necessarily a good thing, as the overall infrastructure simply cannot handle the traffic in generates. I dare you to come here during a Saturday afternoon in December...you will want to kill somebody. Linking the Court and Plaza was a great idea, but having it be a street level, outdoor walkway was a stupid idea. ""Internal"" mall traffic should not interfere with the parking lot traffic, at least, that would make sense to me.

Like any mall nowadays it barely has anything unique or special about it at all...it simply has more of everything. The best part about it is the Rock Bottom brewpub, where you can get some good drinks and pretty decent food and then stumble around the mall and people watch. The latter is a good activity, as you get a neat mix of wannabe sluts, wannabe thugs, country bumpkins, and celebrities.

If you are considering going here, here are some tips and things to think about:

1. Have the whole day to spend to shop, take a break for lunch (California Pizza Kitchen or Cheesecake Factory), and get some coffee at Starbucks.

2. Be in the mood to spend some cash or time to spend scoping out some deals.

3. Be prepared for a lot of people/crowds around. This mall is almost always crowded to some degree.

4. Some stores I always have to check out include: DSW, Urban Outfitters, H&M, Fossil, ALDO, Bloomingdale's, Steve Madden, and Neiman Marcus.

5. If you, like me, do not have an unlimited clothing and shoe budget, be OK with window shopping and enjoying the shopping and fashion experience, without having to buy everything. Going here is sometimes more of an art experience, admiring and appreciating the beautiful fashion at the high-end stores. Some stores I go into I know I probably will not buy anything, but the beautiful clothing is fun to admire or maybe even try on!

One being the recent attempt of human trafficking. The mall has a very large security staff so why was this man following the 2 teenage girls for 90 minutes without any red flags? Also, the security office has a multi-screened computer system with someone always at the desk, so again why was this man allowed to follow the girls for so long without any confrontation or red flags BEFORE they notified their mother. Another reason for the 3 star rating is the rudeness of patrons. I know the mall can't possibly make everyone be nice but some of the things that I'm classifying as 'rude' are common sense and courtesy. 1) walking in the opposite direction in front of a moving stroller. 2) literally walking so slow in front of a moving stroller and then getting irate when the person pushing the stroller accidentally clips your ankles. (Most of the times it's an accident, I'm a mom myself) 3) when you have the whole hallway to move yourself to where you need to go but you rudely cut yourself in front of a family ordering their Easter bunny pictures. And 4) when you're the last person on the elevator and you see a single parent pushing a stroller towards the elevator, and there's enough room, and you push the 'door close' button.

It's been many years since I've been to this mall, and although the stores are awesome, I think it'll be several years before I come back.

The mall is huge and used to be two separate malls until they built the cover enclosure to make it one massive mall.  There's the high-end section of clothing, handbags, jewelry, watches, the mid-price selection of stores, and a couple of cheaper stores.  There was a hefty handful of ""missing"" stores.  Some had signage saying something was coming soon, but not all.  You can tell where the better section (newer) food court is, and although nothing is truly dated here, you can tell the older from the newer.  

Be prepared to walk a lot here.  I wish I had my pedometer to see how many miles I logged in this afternoon.  Wife and I mostly had lunch and window-shopped and ended up spending about 3 hours to get through the whole mall.

Have to say that although parking was only a slight hassle, we were lucky to get a good spot near an entrance.  Also felt that the mall did not seem super crowded even with the many thousands in there.

So although I do not have the super-high-end stores near me, mostly everything else the KoP Mall offers I do have a short drive away from home.  The window shopping was a lot of fun at places we can't afford or can't fit in the clothes, but I have no reason to make the special trip just to come here.  We're very fortunate to have what we have near home.  

Staff placed throughout the mall were extremely helpful.",XD_SGGnLRR-NmdI_jjobZg,160 N Gulph Rd,"Shopping Centers, Fashion, Department Stores, Shopping",King Of Prussia,40.088372,-75.3915726,King of Prussia,19406,477,4.0,PA,1,1

That mall is ingeniously called, King of Prussia Mall.

At the time of this review, this listing is apparently for the MALL, not the town, but Yelp, that's not clear. I asked Yelp to call it, ""King of Prussia Mall,"" and Yelp corrected it for a day, then un-corrected it, so it's back to saying, ""King of Prussia,"" like this is a listing for the town, not the MALL. Whatever.

MALL, MALL, MALL.

This mall is divided into two malls, really, the larger Plaza side (more to the West), and the Court side, east of the Plaza. A covered walkway connects the two if you prefer not to drive around and park from one to another. Just make sure you remember how to get back, because this is an extremely huge property, and you will be walking a very long distance.

KoP claims a location for just about every major retailer in the US, and international companies as well. If the store is not located in the mall proper, it is probably in one of the surrounding shopping centers. One caveat is there is no Dollar Tree anywhere in KoP, nor anywhere nearby. Also, the sole Wawa in KoP is a distance from the mall, almost in Norristown.

Some retailers, like Bath & Body Works, Coach, Pandora, Shake Shack, Starbucks, Sunglass Hut, etc. have duplicate locations, one in each of the Plaza and the Court. Auntie Ann's pretzels has a whopping FIVE locations in the mall! 

KoP is the go-to place to look for a luxury brand in PA (if not in Philly). A good smattering of luxury stores are in KoP, finally a Burberry, then a Gucci arrived a few years ago (just in time for me to have spent $25 to mail an exchange to DC). So the luxe brands are straggling along, arriving fashionably late, I guess. However, if you want Saks, you'll have to go to Bala Cynwyd. Barbour, too, is yonder at Suburban Square (Ardmore). Tod's is nonexistent in the greater Philly area (as their own store). We also have yet to get a Patagonia here in PA (despite FOUR locations in NYC). 

At a time when other US malls are dying out, KoP remains strong. People make this their Friday/Saturday night hangout place, even if just to mill around, and/or go out to eat. Personally, I can't stand the blueish lighting, the clothing starch smells, the dazed people, the obnoxious local teens, etc. enough to do more than get in and out as quickly as possible. But heck, this place is not departing any time soon. The old 80s weekend entertainment is still viable for so many here.

While I don't enjoy hanging out here, I do enjoy this place for its magnitude of retail stores when I need to visit one. I have my parking routine practiced, so I know where to park, depending on what store I need, and I usually pick Nordstrom's lot because it's the easiest in and out ever!

If you're new to the mall, you will probably waste a lot of time figuring out the best route to hit all your stores, and will probably get lost more than once. Also, you should build in a lost 30mins navigating the craziness of all the roads around the mall approach, because it can be confusing just getting into the access roads. And, after all that, on the way home, you may end up headed down 422 instead of the turnpike or something, but you're not alone. Every time I seen an out-of-state plate (even NJ) I get the heck away. I don't want to screw them up, and I don't want to sit behind them as they figure out the behemoth animal that is the KoP Mall! Give yourself a couple trips and you'll have it down.

By comparison, KoP Mall is the 25th largest in the world, which isn't really that big and I didn't get why they had to have a separate building with an uncovered walkway to get there. They even have stores located on the ""Outer Perimeter"" which you have to drive or walk to. 

There isn't much to do here except shop and dine, and the food options are quite limited especially if you're an avid Yelper and like to avoid typical restaurant chains like the plague. If you love shopping then I guess you're in luck since they have every major and not-so-major retail brands.

I see so many people walking around the mall with a map in their hand. Mall is supposed to be convenient, not ""Ugh, where is this store that I'm looking for?""  

Despite its size, I feel like they lack variety when it comes to the stores. Some of the stores are repeated throughout the mall - for instance, there are two Coach stores in the mall, which in my opinion is totally unnecessary. For a mall of this size, you would think there would be Barney's New York or Saks Fifth Avenue, but no. Even Atlanta has them, but not King of Prussia.
